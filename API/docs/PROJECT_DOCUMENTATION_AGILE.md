---

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Quality Gates

All code must pass:
1. ✅ ESLint (code quality)
2. ✅ Prettier (formatting)
3. ✅ Unit tests (> 80% coverage target)
4. ✅ Integration tests
5. ✅ Security scan (no high vulnerabilities)
6. ✅ Peer review (1-2 approvals)
7. ✅ CI/CD pipeline

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- Target: 80% code coverage
- Tools: Jest, Supertest
- Status: ✅ Framework implemented

**Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with real database
- Target: 70% endpoint coverage
- Tools: Jest, Supertest, PostgreSQL
- Status: ✅ Auth service complete

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Branch | Deployment |
|-------------|---------|--------|------------|
| **Development** | Local development | feature/* | Manual |
| **Staging** | Pre-production testing | develop | Automated |
| **Production** | Live system | main | Manual approval |

### Deployment Process

#### Staging Deployment (Automated)
```
1. Developer pushes to 'develop' branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers
3. Run tests (unit, integration)
4. Security scanning
5. Build Docker images
6. Push to container registry
7. Deploy to staging environment
8. Run smoke tests
9. Notify team
```

#### Production Deployment (Manual)
```
1. Merge 'develop' to 'main' (requires approval)
2. GitHub Actions triggers
3. Run all tests
4. Security scanning
5. Build production Docker images
6. Manual approval required
7. Deploy to production
8. Run smoke tests
9. Create GitHub release
10. Notify team
```

### Rollback Strategy

- Blue/green deployment
- Previous Docker images tagged
- Quick rollback: `kubectl rollout undo` or ECS task definition change
- Database migrations: Reversible with rollback scripts
